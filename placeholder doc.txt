Hello! I'm Cedi, and I made this website!

This is my platform for the creative endeavors I'm starting to undertake for myself, including;

- This very website itself!
- And more ideas to come once they're presentable!

If you're reading this, you might be thinking;
"This website is so barebones it's like nothing"
well yeah. this is the placeholder. how'd you get here. who sent you. you CANNOT stop me

But you might also wanna know why I chose *now* out of all times to start a project like this? Well...

- I want to prove to myself that I can
- I want to teach myself and develop more creative skills
- this is just a placeholder I'm deleting this file later
