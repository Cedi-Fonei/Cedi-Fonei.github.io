    <h1>Good mothning!</h1>

    <p>I'm Cedi, and I made this website using GitHub Pages!</p>

    <p>This is my platform for the creative endeavors I'm starting to undertake for myself, including;</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This very website itself!</li>
        <li>And more ideas to come once they are something more than ideas!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you're reading this, you might be thinking;
        "This website is so barebones it's like nothing."
        well yeah. this is the placeholder. it's not supposed to be public knowledge yet. how'd you get here. who sent you. you CANNOT stop me
    </p>

    <p>But you might also wanna know why I chose <i>now</i> out of all times to start a project like this? Well...</p>
    

    <ul>
        <li>I want to prove to myself that I can</li>
        <li>I want to teach myself and develop more creative skills</li>
        <li>I have various ideas and it would be fun to actually put my metaphorical money where my zigzaggy moth mouth is instead of only fantasizing about making them</li>
        <li>The hell years will not end when the orange man is out of office and I want to punch my insecurities in the face</li>
        <li>Through this exercise of self-discovery and self-strengthening I hope to better understand my goals in life</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thanks for giving this page a look! I hope to update you with something cool whenever the time is right~</p>
